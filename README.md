# NaturalSpeech
Give everyone a voice in oldschool! For all characters and players, with over different 900 voices.

Naturalspeech requires an external tool to process text to generate speech. 
At the moment the only supported TTS engine is  [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper).

Make sure that under the `Play` and `Stop` control buttons the location of your piper installation is correct.
If it's not, piper will not work. To change it click on the browse button, and navigate to find `piper.exe` and press `Open`.
