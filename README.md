# NaturalSpeech
Give everyone a voice in oldschool! For all characters and players, with over different 900 voices.

Naturalspeech requires an external tool to process text to generate speech. 
At the moment the only supported TTS engine is  [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper).

## Installing  [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) on Windows.

1. Download the binary from https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases/download/2023.11.14-2/piper_windows_amd64.zip

2. Extract the folder somewhere on your system, for example in ```C:\piper```, so that it is accessible from ```C:\piper\piper.exe```
3. Piper should now be ready to go.

## Installing  [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) on Linux.
1. Find the appropriate version suited for your system from https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases/tag/2023.11.14-2
2. Download the appropriate package and extract it for example in ```~/piper/```
3. Piper should now be ready to go.


After Installing Piper you should be able to use TTS in-game once the voice model is downloaded, and the engine has been started.

or by clicking on the browse button to navigate.
